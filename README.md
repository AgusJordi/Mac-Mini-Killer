Hackintosh setup based on i7-8700 | Gigabyte Z370N | RX560 | 16GB RAM

## About this guide 

This is a beginner guide to make a Hackintosh based on GIGABYTE Z370N WIFI motherboard. It focused on post-install setup. If you don't know how to make a bootable macOS Mojave flash drive and install the macOS Mojave, google it. There is a lot of detail instruction on YouTube. 

Current guide optimised for:
* macOS Mojave 10.14.0
* F10 BIOS for z370n
* FileVault 2 encryption
* AMD RX560/RX570/RX580 or HD630 graphics

I tried to make this guide as simple as possible. Some parts are still a little bit techy, but I'm going to rewrite them soon.
